Welcome! 

The Matlab package you have downloaded was built to 
reproduce most* of the figures in the book 

Sparse and Redundant Representations: From Theory to 
Applications in Signal and Image Processing

Written by Michael Elad (Technion, Israel), and published 
by Springer in September 2010. 

The various functions are organized by the chapter they 
cover, and each file states clearly which figure(s) it 
generates. 

In writing the code, the main emphasis was put on clarity 
and readability of the code, and less on its efficiency. 
In certain cases, the user is encouraged and instructed 
how to modify the code to speed-up the algorithms. This 
is esspecially true for the dictionary learning parts. 

I hope you will benefit from this code. If you find an error, 
you are most welcome to contact me and tell me about it. 
Please write to elad@cs.technion.ac.il .

One last comment: This code is shared freely from my webpage, 
and it comes with no warranty what so ever.

Enjoy,

* Why most? Because some figures are taken from other works, 
  and some figures are part of industrial projects where we 
  have no permission to share the code.
